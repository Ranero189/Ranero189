###I have always been interested in the area of information technology, in 2019 I started my studies in programming languages and techniques on my own, until in 2022 I had the opportunity to enter a higher education course in Computer Science.
###Currently I carry out small personal projects in order to test my knowledge, I continue to improve my skills through courses and communities such as JStack. I seek professional growth and opportunity to develop more and more in my area.
